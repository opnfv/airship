# Drydock BaremetalNode resources for a specific rack are stored in this file.
#
# NOTE: For new sites, you should complete the networks/physical/networks.yaml
# file before working on this file.
#
# In this file, you should make the number of `drydock/BaremetalNode/v1`
# resources equal the number of bare metal nodes you have, either by deleting
# excess BaremetalNode definitions (if there are too many), or by copying and
# pasting the last BaremetalNode in the file until you have the correct number
# of baremetal nodes (if there are too few).
#
# Then in each file, address all additional NEWSITE-CHANGEME markers to update
# the data in these files with the right values for your new site.
#
# *NOTE: The Genesis node is counted as one of the control plane nodes. Note
# that the Genesis node does not appear on this bare metal list, because the
# procedure to reprovision the Genesis host with MaaS has not yet been
# implemented. Therefore there will be only two bare metal nodes in this file
# with the 'masters' tag, as the genesis roles are assigned in a different
# place (type/cntt/profiles/genesis.yaml).

    # will be performed against (for poweron, poweroff, PXE boot to wipe disk or
    # reconfigure identity, etc - very important to get right for these reasons).
    # These addresses should already be assigned to nodes racked and stacked in
    # the environment; these are not addresses which MaaS assigns.

  # plane vs data plane node, and different profiles that map to different types
  # hardware. Select the host profile that matches up to your type of
  # hardware and function. E.g., the r720 here refers to Dell R720 hardware, the
  # 'cp' refers to a control plane profile. Refer to profiles/host/ for the list
  # of available host profiles specific to this site (otherwise, you may find
  # a general set of host profiles at the "type" or "global" layers/folders.
  # If you have hardware that is not on this list of profiles, you may need to
  # create a new host profile for that hardware.
